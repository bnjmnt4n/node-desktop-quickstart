## Files

 * [`index.html`](./index.html): HTML file used for the app.
 * [`main.js`](./main.js): First script executed in the main process, which is used to execute either `electron/main.js` or `nw/main.js`.
 * [`renderer.js`](./renderer.js): First script executed in the renderer process, which is used to execute either `electron/renderer.js` or `nw/renderer.js`. Common functions can be exposed as globals here for easy access from both Electron and NW.js.
